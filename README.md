Find-MD
=======

A repository to help me find the information I need to pick the best doctor 
that my HMO health insurance plan will allow me to pick. 

The full project involves functions to extract doctor names and addresses 
from a pdf file that my insurance company allows me to download, scripts to 
obtain the doctor ratings from several online rating websites, and the tools 
to analyze the ratings I obtain. These tools can easily be abused, and I will
not post them here. You can email me if you need to find a doctor. 

What I am sharing here, is the ratings I got for a number of doctors (the 
doctors') names have been removed, and some neat tools to plot and understand 
the correlations (if any) for the ratings of the same doctors in different 
websites.
