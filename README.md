# Find MD

A repository to help me find the information I need to pick the best doctor that my HMO health insurance plan will allow me to pick. 

What I am sharing here, is the ratings I got for a number of doctors (the doctors') names have been removed, and some neat tools to plot and understand the correlations (if any) for the ratings of the same doctors in different websites, as well as the scripts to use the ratings for picking a doctor. 

I am not posting here the scripts which mine doctor ratings from rating websites. These tools can easily be abused. You can email me if you need to find a doctor. The missing scripts extract doctor names and addresses from a pdf file that my insurance company allows me to download, and scripts which obtain the doctor ratings from several online rating websites. 

Here is a guide to "packaged" IPython notebook sections of this project

1. PCA and bootstrapping analysis (applied to doctor ratings data).
